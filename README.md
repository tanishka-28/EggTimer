### 🛠️ How It Works

* Each egg type has a pre-set timer (5, 7, or 10 minutes)
* Timer starts when you click "Start Timer"
* Time counts down and updates on the screen every second
* At `00:00`, a **ding sound** plays and an alert pops up

### 💡 Tech Used

* **HTML** for structure
* **CSS** for design and layout
* **JavaScript** for timer logic and interactivity
